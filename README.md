# Ping-Pong-Game

A classic Pong game built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. In the game we can control a paddle to bounce a ball and score points. The game features smooth animations, and dynamic scoring. For the Maximum and Minimum score I have used the local storage. I have made the game considering the desktop first approach but it responsive for all website.
