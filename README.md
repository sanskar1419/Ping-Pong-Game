# Calculator

A Simple Calculator web page which can perform various mathematical operation. The Design is similar to the calculator we use. The goal was make it responsive irrespective to device and it can perform basic mathematical function. The approach was simple, first I have structured the layout of both page using HTML, make it look good by styling using CSS and applied the logic using JavaScript.
